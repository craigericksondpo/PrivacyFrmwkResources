**Contributor Notes:** CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and enforcement began on July 1, 2020.  The California Office of the Attorney General is continuing its rulemaking and the California legislature is also continuing to enact amendments to the law.  The CCPA was also amended in a significant way through a citizens ballot initiative (California Privacy Rights Act or CPRA).  This CCPA Crosswalk maps the NIST Privacy Framework to the CCPA but adds notes to alert the readers to changes that were included in the CPRA, which for the most part become enforceable in 2023.  Readers will also notice that many of the Privacy Frameworkâ€™s subcategories that are risk-based do not map neatly to the CCPA.  The CCPA includes a number of thresholds in terms of scope and applicability; however, once the threshold is met, CCPA obligations are largely not risk-based and should be understood as legal requirements.  I have noted sections within the CCPA that would help the readers map certain risk-based subcategories to the CCPA.  To the extent the CCPA is continuing to be amended, rulemaking is revised and the CPRA rulemaking will begin in 2021, I welcome comments and edits to this crosswalk.  I am currently serving as Chair of the Privacy Law Section of the California Lawyers Association (CLA) and invite privacy practitioners interested in monitoring legislative and rulemaking activities in California to join the state bar association.  This crosswalk will be updated with the assistance of CLA Privacy Law Section members.
