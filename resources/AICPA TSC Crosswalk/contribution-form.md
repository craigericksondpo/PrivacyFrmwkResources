**Contributor Notes:** The purpose of mapping the NIST Privacy Framework to the 2017 Trust Services Criteria   (inclusive of October 2022 updates) is to support SOC compliance efforts for organizations aligned with the NIST Privacy Framework. 

This mapping may be leveraged by privacy and GRC teams to perform a SOC readiness assessment and by service auditors to evaluate whether the NIST Privacy Framework may be considered suitable criteria in an attestation examination.

Sincere thanks to Dylan Gilbert, Privacy Policy Advisor at NIST, R. Jason Cronk, Founder of Institute of Operational Privacy Design, and Anza Abbas, Associate at Enterprivacy Consulting Group for their feedback.
