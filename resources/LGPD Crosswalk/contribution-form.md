**Contributor Notes:** At first, we want to highly thank Enterprivacy Consulting Group, as we based our Crosswalk on their mapping from the GDPR to the NIST Privacy Framework. Since Brazilian Law has been inspired by the GDPR, Enterprivacy’s previous work made our job much easier. We were able to adapt Enterprivacy’s work shifting from the GDPR’s items to the LGPD’s ones, preserving their methodology (as we split the LGPD by Chapters and Sections just like they did). 
LGPD went into effect on September 18, 2020. LGPD has been undeniably inspired by the GDPR. People usually say that if you have achieved GDPR compliance you are automatically compliant with LGPD. However, there are some key differences between LGPD and GDPR. Therefore, we hope this Crosswalk can provide some clarity to private sector organizations that need to comply with both legislations.
